# Overlord Backlog

> Cross-repo governance improvements tracked here. Per-repo work goes in each repo's docs/PROGRESS.md.

## Planned

| Item | Priority | Est. Hours | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Schedule overlord-sweep as recurring agent | LOW | 1 | Use `claude schedule` or cron. Depends on governance repo existing. |
| Effectiveness engine baseline metrics | LOW | 4-6 | Collect bug rate, revert rate, CI pass rate per repo per week. Store in metrics/. Requires governance repo. |

## In Progress

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Fail-fast loop closure: live logs + pattern write-back + PR gate event | HIGH | 3 sprints: (1) governance-check.yml → memory-writer on gate failure (2) logs-watcher querying Supabase `/logs/explorer` (3) auto pattern write-back on fix commits |
